### Description:

The goal of this project was to create a browswer based workday planner that displays the current time and date using Moment.JS, and that allows users to store agenda items to local storage and recall them when refreshing or reopening the browswer.

### Usage Instructions: <br>

* Enter agenda item into the desired time slot.
* Click the "save" button on the right hand side to save the agenda item to the browser's local storage.
* Time slots that have already passed for the day are denoted in gray. Future time slots are green. The current hour time slot is always denoted in pink/red. 
* Close or refresh the browser and you will find your agenda items retained in the slots in which they were saved.
* Agenda items may be overwritten and saved by the user as desired.
